# Recent progress in learning 2021-10-7

Recently, I've posted several technical blog posts, some about Vue and some about CSS. This time really do not want to write the company's code, one is afraid to disturb others during the holidays ⛺️ , and the other is that I am very clueless about the code 🖥 , and lazy 🥱.

Each new git project will take a lot of time, yesterday actually  modified 27 notes 📒 , in order to build their own diary platform (Really do not want to send Wechat Moments and Q- Zone, always feel that those are meaningless 💁‍♂️)

There are some of the plans for the next three months:

- Exercise more! Run more! 🏃
- Improve my front-end skills and learn more front-end frameworks
- Explore the meaning of life 🏄
- Looking for motivation at work
- Read the experience and summary of some accomplished people
- Try to read more books 📖 （Maybe not so much time to read）
