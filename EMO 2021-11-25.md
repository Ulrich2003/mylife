一段工作的结束「辅龙」，希望🈶️更好的开始。有些时候挺难对自己的未来做选择的☑️，也对当下的自己感觉到挺一般的。这阵子又没有收入了🈚️，又得重新开始和家里拿钱的日子。希望能快点找到能锻炼自己的，对口的工作（很不容易，自己各方面感觉都很欠缺），现在知识破口挺多的，学习也拉下不少，希望还有时间补回来⌚️。不知道上帝还会给我多少时间，很多时候我害怕自己不行，害怕自己没法养好父母，我还想努力让我弟弟去好学校，我也想去看更广阔的世界。一切想着都挺美好，只希望上帝能给我机会，也让我能够把握好当下，保重好身体。未来咋样，全然交托，其实又很害怕，未来未知太多，变数太多，所谓的梦想，或者是当下的一些不成块的想法💡，能不能实现，还真得看机遇。

At the end of a period of work, "Fulong Beijing", hoping for a better start. Sometimes it's difficult to make choices about my future, and it feels quite normal for myself in the present. There is no income for a while, and I have to start the day of taking money with my family again. I hope I can find a job that I can train myself quickly (it's not easy,I feel very deficient in all aspects of myself). Now I have a lot of knowledge gaps, and I have learned a lot. I hope there is still time to make it up. I don't know how much time God will give me. Many times I am afraid that I will not be able to support my parents. I also want to work hard to get my brother to a good school. I also want to see a wider world. Everything is pretty good. I only hope that God will give me the opportunity to take care of the moment and take good care of my health. What the future looks like, I am completely entrusted, but I am actually very scared. There are too many unknowns and too many variables in the future. The so-called dreams or the current ideas that are not blocky can be realized. It really depends on the opportunities.
